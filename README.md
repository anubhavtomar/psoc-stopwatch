ESE-555 Hardware Software Co-Design
Project Title: Sound Controlled Stopwatch
Functionality description:
1. A microphone is connected to a PSoC chip that implements a stopwatch functionality
by starting and stopping the timer at consecutive whistle blows (sound measurement
mode timer).
2. Alternatively, the system can be also used as a traditional stopwatch with pushbutton
control only (pushbutton controlled only measurement mode).
3. The system incorporates a memory function that saves the last x timing readings
(display the last x recorded samples with statistics).
4. The accuracy of the stopwatch timer can be selected by the user: available resolutions
are 1 second, 1/2 seconds, 1/10 seconds (accuracy setting mode).
5. Microphone sensitivity setting: this functionality allows the user to select the trigger level for the microphone for use in sound mode. Also, the trigger window is selected.
(microphone sensitivity setting mode).
